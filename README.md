GW2ChatLinks is a Kotlin multiplatform library for de- and encoding Guild Wars 2
[chat links](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chat_link_format).

The library is fully written in common Kotlin code. Prebuilt binaries are
available for JVM (Java 11 or later), JS, Wasm, and all native targets.[^1]

[^1]: Since this library does not rely on any platform-specific APIs, we aim to
      provide prebuilt libraries for all native targets supported by Kotlin.
      Despite that, some targets may be missing as target support may change
      over time. In case something is missing, please make sure to let us know.

## Usage

Return values are wrapped in [Result](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-result/)
objects for convenient error handling.


### Encoding chat links

A `ChatLink` object may be encoded into a string using the `encodeChatLink` function.

```kotlin
val chatLink: Result<String> = encodeChatLink(ChatLink.Coin(amount = 10203u))
assertEquals("[&AdsnAAA=]", chatLink.getOrThrow())
```


### Decoding chat links

A `ChatLink` object may be decoded from a string using the `decodeChatLink` function.

```kotlin
val chatLink: Result<ChatLink> = decodeChatLink("[&AdsnAAA=]")
assertEquals(ChatLink.Coin(amount = 10203u), chatLink.getOrThrow())
```


## Building from source

### Setup

This project uses [Gradle's toolchain support](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html)
to detect and select the JDKs required to run the build. Please refer to the
build scripts to find out which toolchains are requested.

An installed JDK 1.8 (or later) is required to use Gradle.

### Building

Once the setup is complete, invoke the respective Gradle tasks using the
following command on Unix/macOS:

    ./gradlew <tasks>

or the following command on Windows:

    gradlew <tasks>

Important Gradle tasks to remember are:
- `clean`                   - clean build results
- `build`                   - assemble and test the project
- `publishToMavenLocal`     - build and install all public artifacts to the
                              local maven repository

Additionally `tasks` may be used to print a list of all available tasks.
